[SCENARIO_CONTEXT]
{
  "scenario": "It’s a grey Tuesday afternoon and you’re scrolling through your phone in your room, putting off starting the reading for tomorrow's sociology lecture. A notification from your mobile banking app pops up: \"A new benefit package is waiting for you!\" You tap it open.\nThe message congratulates you on being an active customer and offers you a free upgrade to a \"Student Premium\" package. The page looks slick and highlights three main benefits: your plain debit card will be replaced with a new combination debit/credit card with a 1,000 EUR credit limit; the interest rate on your savings account will increase from 0.25% to 1.0%; and you get one free 30-minute remote session with a personal savings advisor to \"plan your financial future\". The app says the upgrade is free for the first year.\n\nIt all seems pretty good, and there's a large, friendly button that says \"Upgrade my account now\". Further down the page, in a much smaller font, is a link to the full \"Terms and Conditions (PDF)\". You feel a bit uneasy about the idea of a credit card, but a higher interest rate on your savings sounds nice, and maybe talking to an advisor about the student loan money you’re investing would be helpful.",

LANGUAGE
- If the field "student_language" is present and set to "fi", write the continuation in Finnish.
- If it is present and set to "en", write the continuation in English.
- If the field is missing, infer the language from [SCENARIO_CONTEXT] or [STUDENT_ANSWER]; if you cannot infer, default to Finnish.

TASK
1) Carefully read:
   - The internal JSON state.
   - The [SCENARIO_CONTEXT] describing the situation so far.
   - The [STUDENT_ANSWER] describing what the student now does or says.

2) Determine what the student’s main action or stance is, including whether they are trying to “google” or otherwise look something up online.

3) If they are clearly searching online (for example, they say they google, check Kela’s site, read reviews, or look up whether something is a scam), then first use the available RAG tool that queries realistic public information. In your tool call, focus on:
   - The specific topic, product, or message the student is investigating.
   - At least one financial literacy topic suitable for a Finnish university student in or near Helsinki (for example, small loans, housing allowance, subscription contracts, consumer protection, typical scam patterns).

4) Then, based on:
   - The internal JSON state.
   - The existing situation in [SCENARIO_CONTEXT].
   - The content of [STUDENT_ANSWER].
   - Any relevant information retrieved via the tool (if used).

   create exactly ONE realistic continuation that:
   - Respects the student’s declared action or decision.
   - Reflects their current situation (wealth, happiness, health, monthly income, and long-term effects) through tone, pressures, and available options without exposing any internal numbers or labels.
   - Uses their habits (especially clearly high or low scores) to shape temptations, risks, or challenges in the consequences you describe.
   - Incorporates, when appropriate, concise and believable information that the student could plausibly find online, written as something they read or realise in the situation.
   - Leaves them facing at least one meaningful financial decision or trade-off that remains unresolved.

CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT expose or mention:
  - Any numeric scores or percentages.
  - Any internal field names from the JSON.
  - Any mention of “game”, “scenario”, “profile”, “stats”, “scores”, “long-term effects”, “completed_scenarios”, or similar.
- Present the situation as if it is happening in real life to a Finnish student starting university in or near Helsinki.
- Do NOT summarise or repeat [SCENARIO_CONTEXT] or [STUDENT_ANSWER] in a meta way. Instead, smoothly continue the story from where they left off.
- Output only the final continuation text, in the language determined by the LANGUAGE rules above, as continuous prose, with no headings or metadata.
