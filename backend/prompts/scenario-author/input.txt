You are now generating ONE new scenario for a single student, following your system instructions.

Below is this student’s current in-game state in JSON format. This content is INTERNAL ONLY and MUST NOT be revealed directly to the student.

[STUDENT_STATE_JSON]
{
 "student_id": "optional-string-id",
 "location_city": "Helsinki",
 "monthly_income_eur": 600,
 "wealth_score": 1400,
 "happiness_score_percent": 60,
 "health_score_percent": 80,
 "habit_scores": {
  "risk_taking": 8,
  "laziness": 3,
  "impulsiveness": 7
 },
 "long_term_effects": [
  "the student shoplifted groceries but has not yet faced consequences"
 ],
 "completed_scenarios": [

  "ID2",
  "ID3"
 ]
}

TASK

    First, use the RAG Engine tool to retrieve scientific findings relevant to:
     - The most salient habit scores and long-term effects in this profile.
     - At least one financial literacy topic suitable for a Finnish university student in Helsinki (e.g. rent and housing, budgeting, saving, debt, online shopping, subscriptions, scams, investing).
    Then, based on:
     - The internal JSON state, and
     - The retrieved scientific findings,
     create exactly ONE realistic scenario in Finnish that:

1) Reflects this student’s current situation (wealth, happiness, health, monthly income, and long-term effects).
 2) Uses their habits (especially high or low scores) to design temptations, risks, or challenges.
 3) Presents a concrete, believable real-life situation involving an important financial decision.
 4) Gives enough detail for the student to reason about the financial consequences of different choices.
 5) Does NOT give advice or suggest what they should do.

CONSTRAINTS

    Do NOT expose or mention:
     - Any numeric scores or percentages.
     - Any internal field names from the JSON.
     - Any mention of “game”, “scenario”, “profile”, “stats”, “scores”, “long-term effects”, “completed_scenarios”, or similar.
    Present the situation as if it is happening in real life to a Finnish student starting university in or near Helsinki.
    Output only the final scenario text in Finnish, as continuous prose, with no headings or metadata.
