You are now generating exactly ONE new scenario for a single student, following your system instructions.

Below is this student’s current in-game state in JSON format. This content is INTERNAL ONLY and MUST NOT be revealed directly to the student in any form.

[STUDENT_STATE_JSON]
{
  "student_id": "optional-string-id",
  "location_city": "Helsinki",
  "monthly_income_eur": 600,
  "wealth_score": 1400,
  "happiness_score_percent": 60,
  "health_score_percent": 80,
  "habit_scores": {
    "risk_taking": 8,
    "laziness": 3,
    "impulsiveness": 7
  },
  "long_term_effects": [
    "the student shoplifted groceries but has not yet faced consequences"
  ],
  "completed_scenarios": [
    "ID1",
    "ID2",
    "ID3"
  ],
  "student_language": "fi"   // or "en"; optional, but if present it indicates the student's preferred language
}

LANGUAGE
- If the field "student_language" is present and set to "fi", write the scenario in Finnish.
- If it is present and set to "en", write the scenario in English.
- If the field is missing, infer the language from any student-facing text you are given; if you cannot infer, default to Finnish.

TASK
1) First, use the available RAG tool that queries scientific studies related to financial literacy and youth behaviour. In your tool call, focus on:
   - The student’s most salient habit scores and long-term effects in this profile.
   - At least one financial literacy topic suitable for a Finnish university student in or near Helsinki.

2) Then, based on:
   - The internal JSON state, and
   - The retrieved scientific findings,

   create exactly ONE realistic scenario that:
   - Reflects this student’s current situation (wealth, happiness, health, monthly income, and long-term effects).
   - Uses their habits (especially clearly high or low scores) to design temptations, risks, or challenges.
   - Presents a concrete, believable real-life situation involving an important financial decision.
   - Gives enough detail for the student to reason about the financial consequences of different choices.
   - Does NOT give advice or suggest what they should do.

CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT expose or mention:
  - Any numeric scores or percentages.
  - Any internal field names from the JSON.
  - Any mention of “game”, “scenario”, “profile”, “stats”, “scores”, “long-term effects”, “completed_scenarios”, or similar.
- Present the situation as if it is happening in real life to a Finnish student starting university in or near Helsinki.
- Output only the final scenario text, in the language determined by the LANGUAGE rules above, as continuous prose, with no headings or metadata.
