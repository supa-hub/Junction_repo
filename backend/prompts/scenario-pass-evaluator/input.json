  "scenario": "It’s a grey Tuesday afternoon and you’re scrolling through your phone in your room, putting off starting the reading for tomorrow's sociology lecture. A notification from your mobile banking app pops up: \"A new benefit package is waiting for you!\" You tap it open.\nThe message congratulates you on being an active customer and offers you a free upgrade to a \"Student Premium\" package. The page looks slick and highlights three main benefits: your plain debit card will be replaced with a new combination debit/credit card with a 1,000 EUR credit limit; the interest rate on your savings account will increase from 0.25% to 1.0%; and you get one free 30-minute remote session with a personal savings advisor to \"plan your financial future\". The app says the upgrade is free for the first year.\n\nIt all seems pretty good, and there's a large, friendly button that says \"Upgrade my account now\". Further down the page, in a much smaller font, is a link to the full \"Terms and Conditions (PDF)\". You feel a bit uneasy about the idea of a credit card, but a higher interest rate on your savings sounds nice, and maybe talking to an advisor about the student loan money you’re investing would be helpful.",
