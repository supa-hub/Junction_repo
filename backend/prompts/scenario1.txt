You sit on your bed with your laptop open and a piece of paper next to you. On the top of the paper you’ve written: “{{monthlyIncome}} €/month”. That’s what you expect to have once studies in Helsinki start, and you know most of it will disappear into rent, food and an HSL card. People keep telling you that there are special student housing organisations and rental sites you should “definitely check”, but you realise you don’t actually know any of them by name, and your browser search box is still empty.

Your parents have offered a simple option: stay at home for at least the first year if you pay them 150 € per month towards food and bills and buy your own, more expensive, commuter ticket. It would be cheap and safe, but you’d have a long trip to campus and feel less independent. Another idea you’ve been toying with is just accepting the first half-decent room or studio you see in a random online ad or social media group, without systematically comparing prices, deposits or contracts, just so you can say you’re moving out. Or you could take an evening now to properly hunt down the main student housing providers and rental platforms yourself, go through their offers, and try to calculate what different options would really cost each month with your {{monthlyIncome}}. Application times for autumn are getting closer, and your parents are asking for a decision; you have to choose how much effort you will put into actually finding and comparing student housing before you decide where to live.
