Boxes are still half-unpacked in your small Helsinki studio when a white envelope drops through the mail slot. It’s from the local electricity network company: you need to make an electricity contract with a supplier by a certain date, otherwise you’ll automatically be put on a basic contract that “may be more expensive”. You stare at the letter and realise you have no idea which electricity companies exist, how prices are usually shown, or where people actually compare offers. Your laptop is open on the desk, but the browser search field is empty.

Your landlord has texted you a link and written “I use this company, just take the same, it’s fine”. The link leads straight to a sign-up page that mentions a monthly basic fee, a price per kilowatt-hour and some small print about contract length and price changes, but you don’t really understand what counts as cheap or expensive. In a group chat, a new course mate says they just clicked the first ad they saw online and took a contract “that sounded cheap”, without reading much. You could follow one of these quick paths and get the whole thing done in a couple of minutes, accepting that you don’t really know if it’s a good deal, or you could set aside time now to search for electricity suppliers and any comparison tools yourself, trying to figure out what fixed vs exchange-priced electricity, contract length and different fees would mean for your future monthly bills. The deadline in the letter is only a few days away, and you need to decide how you’ll actually choose your electricity contract.
