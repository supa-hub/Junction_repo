On a grey Tuesday morning you sit in your small room in Helsinki, laptop open and phone in hand, trying to figure out how you’ll get to campus and back, plus to all the evening meetups your new classmates keep suggesting. You’ve decided there are three realistic options for you: cycling, buying a monthly HSL ticket or getting your own electric scooter. You’ve heard that a good used bike might not be that expensive, that student-priced HSL tickets are “pretty reasonable”, and that electric scooters cost a few hundred euros to buy, but you realise you don’t actually know what any of these would really mean for your monthly budget.

You open a new browser tab and stare at the empty search box. You could just go to a random bike shop this week and buy something that looks okay without comparing prices or thinking too much about locks, winter riding and maintenance costs. You could log into the public transport app, click through quickly and take the first monthly ticket option that seems to cover your home and campus, without really checking what different zone choices or ticket types would cost over a whole semester. Or you could decide you want an electric scooter and start browsing online ads and webshops, focusing on a cool-looking model now and only vaguely thinking about battery life, possible repairs and where you’re allowed to ride and park it. Another possibility is to spend an evening actually searching for up-to-date information on bike prices, student HSL ticket options and realistic total costs of owning a scooter, trying to compare what each choice would mean for your money and daily life. The first lecture period is about to start, invites to after-lectures coffees and parties are popping up in your chat, and you need to decide both how you’ll move around the city and how much effort you’re willing to put into finding out the real costs before choosing between the three options.
