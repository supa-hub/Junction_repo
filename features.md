- User profiles that are created on per-user basis. A classroom is created for the students, where they participate in a game. The classroom is prepared by a teacher with the basic information about the classroom like location, monthly income. 

- A game is designed to last around 45 minutes, where users receive lifelike situations that they answer in natural language with a response to the stiuation, that affect their financial situation, health, happiness etc. After a game the teacher is given an analysis of the whole classrooms financial literacy to give guidance to the whole classroom about their results in realtime, and guide them on their weakpoints. The players see a leaderboard to compare each other to their peers. Each user can also see their individual weakpoints in their financial literacy. These games can also be played multiple times during a students occupancy in high school, allowing information about the classrooms development in their financial literacy, and users can see their individual progress.

After each scenario is completed, the users stats are modified accordingly.

- The core scenarios have to be completed and the app will recognize slower players by following how many scenarios they complete per minute, and the core scenarios will be dynamically offered to make sure all users complete them by the end of the game.

- Will use the OPO opetussuunnitelma to give teaching recommendations for future lessons. AI will generate a PDF report of the whole simulation for analysis by the school system for future improvements.
